# brms.mmrm 0.0.2.9001 (development)

* Deprecate `brm_simulate()` in favor of `brm_simulate_simple()` (#3). The latter has a more specific name to disambiguate it from other simulation functions, and its parameterization conforms to the one in the methods vignette. 

# brms.mmrm 0.0.2

* Fix grammatical issues in the description.

# brms.mmrm 0.0.1

* First version.
