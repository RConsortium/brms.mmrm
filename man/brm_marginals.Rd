\usage{
brm_marginals(
  model,
  base = "BASE",
  group = "TRT01P",
  time = "AVISIT",
  patient = "USUBJID",
  covariates = character(0),
  outcome = "change",
  control = "Placebo",
  baseline = "Baseline"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Fitted \code{brms} model object from \code{\link[=brm_model]{brm_model()}}.}

\item{base}{Character of length 1, name of the baseline response variable
in the data.}

\item{group}{Character of length 1, name of the treatment group
variable in the data.}

\item{time}{Character of length 1, name of the discrete time variable
in the data.}

\item{patient}{Character of length 1, name of the patient ID variable
in the data.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of names of other covariates
in the data.}

\item{outcome}{Character of length 1, \code{"response"} if the
response variable is the raw outcome variable (such as AVAL)
or \code{"change"} if the response variable is change from baseline
(e.g. CHG).}

\item{control}{Element of the \code{group} column in the data which indicates
the control group for the purposes of calculating treatment differences.}

\item{baseline}{Element of the \code{time} column in the data
which indicates the baseline time for the purposes of calculating
change from baseline.}
}
\value{
A named list of tibbles of MCMC samples of the marginal posterior
distribution of each treatment group and time point:
\itemize{
\item \code{response}: on the scale of the response variable.
\item \code{change}: change from baseline, where the \code{baseline} argument determines
the time point at baseline. Only returned if the \code{outcome} argument is
\code{"response"}. (If \code{outcome} is \code{"change"}, then \code{response} already
represents change from baseline.)
\item \code{difference}: treatment effect of change from baseline, where the
\code{control} argument identifies the placebo or active control group.
In each tibble, there is 1 row per posterior sample and one column for
each type of marginal distribution (i.e. each combination of treatment
group and discrete time point.
Treatment and time are comma-delimited in the column names.
}
}
\description{
Get marginal posteior samples from a fitted MMRM.
}
\details{
Currently assumes the response variable is \code{CHG}
(change from baseline) and not \code{AVAL} (raw response).
